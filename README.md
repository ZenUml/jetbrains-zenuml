# jetbrains-zenuml
The ZenUML plugin running on the JetBrains IDEs.

<!-- Plugin description -->
This official extension integrates [ZenUML](https://ZenUML.com/) directly into all JetBrains IDEs.
It supports ZenUML diagram files with the extensions `.z`, `.zen` and `.zenuml`.

The editor uses an offline version of ZenUML renderer, therefore it works without an internet connection and content stays local in your IDE.

# Development
1. Java version: OpenJDK 11 or higher.
1. `./gradlew`
1. `./gradlew runIde` to start another instance of IDEA with our plugin installed.
    ## Using Gradle In IntelliJ
    If you get an error like this:
    > Cause: org/openjfx/gradle/JavaFXPlugin has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0

    you need to change `Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle JVM` to version 11 or higher.
