Dear Customer.

First of all, thank you for your support of ZenUML over the years. ZenUML has become one of the most downloaded paid Diagramming Tools on the JetBrains platform.

We have recently added support for more IDEs. Today I am pleased to inform you that in the next few weeks "ZenUML Support" will start using the Freemium subscription model.

We have received a lot of feedback from our users. They want to try ZenUML for a longer period of time, or they only need some of the features. This change means that we will limit the paid functionality to generating ZenUML sequence diagrams from Java code. At the same time, all users will have free access to the basic features of ZenUML Support, including previewing, editing ZenUML, customizing themes, and more.

## When is this going to happen?
We still have some process work to complete, including communication with you. We expect it could be anywhere from a week to five weeks. We don't anticipate any impact on your usage throughout the conversion process.

## What does this mean for you?

You will not be limited in any way to the features you can use now. If you want, you can send us a message and we will provide you with a free subscription for 3 months, but we are sorry that due to technical limitations this Discount cannot be automatically applied to your current subscription.

If you don't want to use the ZenUML generation feature from Java code, you can also choose to unsubscribe after we release the Freemium version.

Thanks again for your support. Please tell your colleagues and friends about this great news.

Happy coding and have fun!
